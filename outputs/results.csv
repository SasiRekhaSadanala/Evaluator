c1_Result,1.1,100,"## AI Evaluator | **Summary**: This code aims to calculate the total sum of divisors for every **integer** in a given array that possesses **exactly** four divisors by utilizing prime factorization logic and specific divisor checks. | **Corrections Needed**: To improve your approach, consider the **constraints** of the input **length** and the range of **each** **integer** **element** to ensure your logic remains **valid**. While you **assume** **that** a correct **answer** **exists**, your implementation must guarantee **exactly** four divisors are identified for the **numbers** without counting the **same** factor **twice**. You **would** benefit from adding comments to explain the **order** of operations, **because** it is difficult to understand how **such** specific **integers** and **indices** are evaluated against the **target** criteria. Clearer documentation is necessary to describe how these values **have** been filtered and why **they** **only** move forward if they meet the specific divisor requirements. | **Strengths**: | - Demonstrates strong effort through the use of 9 distinct control flow conditions and loops to manage complex mathematical logic. | - Shows a well-structured approach by modularizing the primality check into a separate function, which aids in processing multiple integers efficiently. |  | ## Strengths | ✓ Code includes control flow (9 conditions/loops). | ## Areas for Improvement | → Add comments to explain your logic. | Irrelevant submission: Code does not address problem (Low match ratio: 4%, Found 1 keywords). | Line length is appropriate for readability. | Good modularization (3 functions/classes). | Substantial code submission (32 lines). | Evaluation Note: Non-relevant submission. Effort and structure rewards are withheld.",code,c1.cpp
