Report_Result,80.0,100,→ Add more transition words to improve flow between ideas.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,→ Add concrete examples to support your concepts.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"The evaluation is based on criteria addressing the quality of the content (Coverage, Completeness) and the quality of presentation (Alignment, Flow).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"Your submission demonstrated **excellent concept coverage**, successfully integrating 10 out of 12 required concepts. This indicates a high level of domain understanding related to your topic.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,**Areas for Revision:**,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"While the technical implementation was clearly explained (e.g., RAG, FAISS, offline LLMs), the submission lightly missed a complete discussion regarding two key semantic areas:",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"1.  **Missing Discussion of Fundamental Components:** The report did not fully address the concept of what constitutes the **fundamental** or foundational elements that drive the system’s primary functionality, beyond listing the specific technical tools (e.g., FAISS).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"2.  **Missing Discussion of Human-like Interaction:** The report did not thoroughly explore how the system aims to mimic **human-like** interaction patterns, especially concerning the nuance of the generated responses and the user experience when interacting with the RAG output.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"Your submission is **well-organized** with clear section breaks and strong, varied sentence structures. The overall structure aligns logically with presenting a technical proposal (Problem -> Solution -> Architecture -> Implementation).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,**Areas for Revision (Flow):**,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"The primary area for improvement in this category relates to the cohesion between ideas. Although you have many clear sections, the automated analysis suggests the writing would benefit from better **flow between paragraphs and ideas**. This means that while individual sentences are clear, the transition words or linking phrases used to connect one detailed technical step to the next could be strengthened.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"Your content is **substantial** (555 words) and includes necessary reasoning and evidence, particularly in Section 3 (Proposed Solution) and Section 4 (System Architecture).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,**Areas for Revision (Completeness):**,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"The findings noted that while the reasoning is sound, the submission currently **lacks concrete examples**. A good technical report should illustrate its concepts in action. You define *what* the system does (e.g., ""retrieves relevant chunks""), but you do not show *how* that feels or functions in a specific user scenario. Adding these examples deepens the reader’s understanding and substantiates your claims.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"To maximize the impact of your excellent core content, focus on strengthening conceptual depth and structural flow.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   **Integrate Fundamental Components:** When discussing the architecture (Section 4), explicitly state which components are **fundamental** to the RAG process (e.g., the vector index and the offline LLM are the core computational components), and explain *why* they cannot be substituted without altering the system's nature.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   **Enhance Human-like Interaction Discussion:** In Section 1 or 6, briefly expand on how the RAG mechanism (through accurate retrieval and citation) improves upon traditional search to deliver a more **natural** or human-like Q\&A experience, contrasting it with the keyword search limitations mentioned in Section 1.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"Strengthen the connections between different stages of your technical explanation, especially when moving between the indexing pipeline and the query pipeline.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   **Example 1 (Between Architecture Steps):** Revise the start of the ""Offline Query and Answering Pipeline"" (Section 4) to include a transition.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   *Current structure:* Lists indexing pipeline, then lists query pipeline.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   *Suggestion:* Use a phrase like, ""Once the indexing pipeline establishes the local knowledge base, the system seamlessly transitions to the **Offline Query and Answering Pipeline** to handle user requests...""",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   **Example 2 (Within Technical Detail):** When describing the query process (Section 3), use transitional adverbs to link embedding generation, retrieval, and augmentation.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   *Suggestion:* ""The query is embedded; **subsequently**, it is compared with stored document embeddings. **Following this retrieval step**, the most relevant chunks are combined...""",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,Introduce a specific scenario to demonstrate the functionality of the system and make the content more vivid.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   **Implement a ""Scenario Box"":** Add a small sub-section demonstrating a flow.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   *Example:* Define a user query (e.g., ""What is the procedure for Q4 financial reporting under the new compliance rules?"").",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,80.0,100,"*   *Detail the process:* Show how the query is embedded, which relevant documents/pages the FAISS index retrieves, and how the Mistral LLM uses *only* that retrieved context to generate a verifiable answer, complete with citation metadata. This provides the concrete example currently missing.",content,Report.pdf
