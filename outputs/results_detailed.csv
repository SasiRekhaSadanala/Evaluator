c1_Result,85.0,100,## Areas for Improvement,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,→ Add comments to explain your logic.,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,→ Consider breaking code into more functions for reusability.,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"Your submission demonstrated solid technical organization and effort, successfully defining a class and utilizing control flow structures. However, the evaluation highlighted a critical deviation in the core objective and approach criteria.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,The **Approach** criterion evaluates whether the code correctly addresses the problem's underlying concepts and logical requirements.,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**Logical Explanation:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"The evaluation determined that the central concept of the assignment was fundamentally missed. While your code is well-structured and performs a calculation related to finding minimum time/distance between points, the assignment required a solution centered on complex grid manipulation. Specifically, the required concepts involved managing arrays of integers representing available horizontal (`hbars`) and vertical (`vbars`) bars within a grid, and calculating the maximum area of a resulting square-shaped hole.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"The automated system confirmed only one partial concept match, indicating that the submitted solution, `minTimeToVisitAllPoints`, did not align with the overall required logical framework for calculating the area of a dynamic grid hole.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**Missing Conceptual Understanding:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"The assignment required you to solve a problem where you were given two sets of integers, corresponding to horizontal and vertical bars in a grid. These bars define unit cells. Your task was to identify the maximum area of a single, contiguous square-shaped hole achievable in the grid after hypothetically removing a specified set of bars. The overall goal was to return an integer denoting the maximum possible area.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"Your submission shows good initial organization, but there are areas for improvement regarding code clarity and modularity.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**Structure:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"You correctly organized the code using a class (`Solution`) containing a single function. This demonstrates foundational structural understanding. However, the finding suggests that for improved modularity and future reusability, the logic could be decomposed further.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**Readability:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"The line length is appropriate, promoting easy reading. However, a significant finding was the lack of internal documentation. Adding comments is essential for explaining complex or non-obvious logical steps, ensuring that another programmer (or the grader) can quickly understand *why* certain decisions were made.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,---,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"Based on the findings, here are specific improvements you can implement for your next submission.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**1. Address Conceptual Alignment:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   **Focus on the Assigned Problem:** Ensure that the function signature, variable names, and core logic directly address the prompt concerning 'maximum area square-shaped hole in a grid defined by bars.' The current submission is solving a different shortest path/time problem.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**2. Improve Readability and Documentation:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   **Add Logic Comments:** Introduce concise comments, especially within the control flow, to explain the goal of the calculation being performed.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   *Example in your current code:* In the loop, add a comment explaining that the `max(abs(it[0]-points[i][0]),abs(it[1]-points[i][1]))` calculation specifically uses the Chebyshev distance (L-infinity norm) to determine the time/distance moved.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   **Document Variable Intent:** While variable names (`ans`, `it`, `n`) are short, consider adding a comment at the top of the function explaining what `it` represents (the previously visited point).",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,**3. Enhance Code Structure and Reusability:**,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   **Implement Functional Decomposition:** To increase reusability, identify logical units that can be separated.",code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,85.0,100,"*   *Example:* Even in your current solution, the calculation of the distance between two points is a self-contained unit. Consider extracting the distance logic into a private helper function (e.g., `calculate_distance(p1, p2)`) that the main function calls iteratively. This specifically addresses the suggestion to break code into more functions.",code,c1.cpp
