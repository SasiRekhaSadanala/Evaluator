Report_Result,61.95,100,→ Add more transition words to improve flow between ideas.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,→ Add concrete examples to support your concepts.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"Your submission successfully covered 7 out of the 12 required concepts, providing a solid foundation for the RAG architecture, problem statement, and component selection.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"**Why this matters:** Since Coverage carries the highest weight, the partial inclusion of required topics significantly impacts the overall result.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,**Missing Concept Analysis:**,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"The current report focuses effectively on the architecture and components (LLM, FAISS index, chunking) but requires expansion in the following areas:",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,1.  **System Functionality:** Include a detailed list of the essential user-facing services and functionalities offered by the portal (beyond simple Q&A).,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"2.  **Implementation Context:** Explain the specific time-bound and focused nature of the initial development or prototyping environment, and the rapid methodology used.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,3.  **Source Material Specifics:** Elaborate on the variety of knowledge repositories and file types the system is explicitly designed to handle as internal reference materials.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,4.  **Core Mechanism Description:** Provide a more explicit definition and functional breakdown of the component responsible for retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"5.  **Engineering Detail:** Dive deeper into the specific engineering constraints, optimization techniques (like quantization), and infrastructure requirements necessary for maintaining purely offline operation.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"Your alignment is successful. The report consistently includes robust **reasoning or evidence** to support your proposed solution, particularly in justifying the need for offline operation to address privacy and security concerns (Section 2) and in explaining the use of specific tools like FAISS for local indexing (Section 3).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"The overall length of the submission (555 words) is substantial. However, the explanation currently lacks specific evidence to fully complete the arguments.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"**Why this matters:** The findings indicate a need to **add concrete examples to support your concepts.** While the RAG process is described, demonstrating *how* these steps manifest in practice will strengthen the completeness of the report.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"The flow is generally strong. The document is **well-organized** into 280 distinct sections, and the sentence structure is clear and varied.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"**Improvement Note:** To enhance the seamless transition between complex technical steps, you should **add more transition words to improve flow between ideas.**",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"Use the following specific, actionable steps to strengthen your report by addressing the partial coverage and lack of concrete examples:",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **Specify the Retrieval Component:** In Section 3, explicitly identify and describe the FAISS index/logic as the **Retriever**. Elaborate on *how* the retrieval step calculates similarity and selects the top-$k$ chunks.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **Detail System Features:** In Section 6 (""Expected Outcomes""), expand on the end-user experience by listing concrete **features**. Examples include: user authentication roles, history tracking for queries, or a mechanism for users to rate the quality of the generated answers.",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **Clarify Source Material (Docs):** While you mention PDF, DOCX, and TXT, specify the types of internal knowledge your system handles (e.g., standard operating procedures, HR manuals, research **docs**, or compliance reports).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,*   **Add Concrete Examples:**,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **For Citations:** When discussing citations in Section 3, provide an example of the output citation format (e.g., ""The answer is based on [Document ID: Policy-2024] p. 14"").",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **For Technical Implementation:** In Section 5, briefly mention a specific **technical** detail about the resource constraints for the LLM (e.g., ""Quantization ensures the LLM fits within 8 GB of VRAM, critical for offline desktop deployment"").",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   **Reference the Implementation Context:** If applicable, add a brief mention of the project's rapid prototyping phase or dedicated development environment (e.g., mention the project originated in a **hackathon** setting to frame the rapid development cycle).",content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,*   Review technical paragraphs (especially Section 3: Proposed Solution) and insert transitional phrases to connect sequential actions.,content,Report.pdf
Report_Result,61.95,100,"*   *Example Revision (Section 3):* Instead of moving directly from chunking to embedding, add a linker: ""...divided into overlapping chunks to maintain semantic meaning across sections. **Following this crucial preparation step,** each chunk is converted into a vector embedding..."" (Words like *Consequently*, *Subsequently*, or *In parallel* are useful connectors).",content,Report.pdf
