c1_Result,1.1,100,## AI Evaluator,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,1.1,100,**Summary**: This code aims to calculate the total sum of divisors for every **integer** in a given array that possesses **exactly** four divisors by utilizing prime factorization logic and specific divisor checks.,code,c1.cpp
c1_Result,1.1,100,"**Corrections Needed**: To improve your approach, consider the **constraints** of the input **length** and the range of **each** **integer** **element** to ensure your logic remains **valid**. While you **assume** **that** a correct **answer** **exists**, your implementation must guarantee **exactly** four divisors are identified for the **numbers** without counting the **same** factor **twice**. You **would** benefit from adding comments to explain the **order** of operations, **because** it is difficult to understand how **such** specific **integers** and **indices** are evaluated against the **target** criteria. Clearer documentation is necessary to describe how these values **have** been filtered and why **they** **only** move forward if they meet the specific divisor requirements.",code,c1.cpp
