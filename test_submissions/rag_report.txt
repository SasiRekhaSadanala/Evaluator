This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Offline AI-Powered RAG Knowledge Portal implementation.

The system architecture consists of several key components. First, we implement document indexing using FAISS for efficient vector storage. The embeddings are generated using a local model to ensure complete offline functionality.

The retriever-generator pipeline follows a standard RAG approach. Documents are chunked and embedded, then stored in the FAISS index. When a query arrives, we retrieve relevant chunks and pass them to the offline LLM for generation.

For the offline LLM, we use Phi-3 Mini which provides good performance on CPU-only hardware. This ensures the system can run without GPU requirements, making it accessible for privacy-focused organizations.

The implementation plan includes three phases:
1. Document ingestion and indexing setup
2. Retrieval system with FAISS integration  
3. Generation pipeline with Phi-3 Mini

Security and privacy are paramount. All data remains on-premises with no external API calls. The system is designed for organizations that require strict data isolation.

Evaluation metrics will include retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and system latency. We'll benchmark against standard RAG datasets to ensure performance meets expectations.
